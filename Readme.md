<strong>This example is outdated</strong>

<p>Starting with v.11.2.5 of our components, GridControl supports touch scrolling out of the box - [XtraGrid - Provide Touch Screen Scrolling like IPhone Does](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/s133550/xtragrid-provide-touch-screen-scrolling-like-iphone-does). So, you don't need to add any helper or change any property.This helper was created when this functionality was not supported by default. You can utilize the helper class from this example in case you are using an older version of our components or, for example, want to implement custom touch scrolling behavior.</p><br />
